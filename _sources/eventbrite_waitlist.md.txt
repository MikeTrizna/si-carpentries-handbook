# Eventbrite Waitlist

If a person reaches out to indicate that they are unable to attend the workshop, DO NOT CANCEL their registration immediately. That will open a registration spot, without automatically "upgrading" someone from the Wait List.

First, navigate to the Wait List ("Order Options" > "Manage Waitlist"). Then select the checkbox next to the first person listed in the Wait List, and click the "Release Tickets" button.

Eventbrite will give a pop-up to confirm you want to release a ticket. You do.

When you confirm, an email is sent from Eventbrite to that participant, and they have 1 day to "claim" that ticket. They usually claim it fairly quickly, but you may want to email them directly if you don't hear back within a few hours.

When that person claims their ticket, the class will then have 1 participant more than capacity. This means that when you go to cancel the initial person's ticket, it will not open a spot for someone to skip the waitlist.

To cancel a ticket, navigate to the order list ("Manage attendees" > "Orders"), locate the person whose ticket you would like to cancel, and then select "Cancel this Order" next to their name.
