# Eventbrite Ticketing

* Go to eventbrite.com, and click the "Sign In" button. (Ask Mike for our account email and password)

* It will be tempting to go ahead and click "Create Event", but hold off on that. Hover over the profile image in the top-right corner and go down to Manage Events.

* You should now be on the Events page. By default, you should see all past events listed here, but make sure that the "Event status" dropdown is set to "Past".

* Choose the most recent quarterly workshop, click on the triple-colon symbol, and select Copy Event.

* This will take all of the set-up details from that previous workshop, and bring them over to a new event. Update the Event Title, Event Startdate, Event Enddate, and click the Copy Event button.

* You will see a spinning status wheel, and then it will put you into the Event Dashboard.

* Things still left to change:
    * Under Basic Info, change the location if it will be somewhere other than the Castle Library
    * Under Details, change the Summary and description to update dates and course descriptions.
    * Under Tickets, click the triple-colon symbol and then Edit. Set the appropriate date and start time for tickets to become available.

* Click the "Preview" button at the top of the page to make sure that all details look right.

* If everything checks out, click the Publish Event dropdown at the top, and click Publish Now.

* Finally, go back to the Event website, and add the "EID" from the EventBrite event URL to index.md.
