# Pre-workshop Checklist

This checklist aims to help organize Carpentry Workshops at the Smithsonian. 

## Workshop Instructors and Helpers

* Co-instructors (teaching in pairs is recommended by The Carpentries)
	* List of SI Carpentry instructors can be found [here](https://datascience.si.edu/carpentries#instructors).
* Helpers (one helper for every 8-10 learners)
	* We suggest the instructors invite new helpers from their respective departments and help us grow our SI Carpentries Community.
	* [Helpers cheat sheet](https://github.com/mtntsuchiya/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/handouts/helpers.pdf)
